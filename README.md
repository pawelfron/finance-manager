# finance-manager

App for managing personal finances. Allows users to enter expenses and earnings and have them analyzed.

So far, the analysis part is just displaying a chart of expenses and earnings for each month; however the data can be adjusted for inflation, based on data from the [European Central Bank](https://data.ecb.europa.eu/help/api/data).

The only supported currency is the Polish ZÅ‚oty (PLN).
